Possible projects.

Models:
- Reeds shepp 2D with adaptive discretization of orientations, to match small integer vectors. 


Algorithm:
- Simultaneaous computation of euclidean path length.
- Time dependent velocity. (Computation with speed at time of first accepted neighbor, recompute to refine).
- Time dependent obstacles. (Multi-valued value map.)
- Stitch together several grids. (Requires : covering region, adaptation to geodesic backtracing)
